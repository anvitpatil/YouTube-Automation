YouTube Automation using Selenium in Python

An unsuccessful optional project I have been working on (unsuccessful_gmail_creator.py) has been uploaded. It is not the main project.
The main project script is youtube_automation.py

Instructions on how to run the code:
1. Python Selenium module, Mozilla Firefox browser and Mozilla Firefox WebDriver(geckodriver executable placed in /usr/local/bin) are required to run this python automation script.
2. Open Ubuntu Terminal and execute the python file using: python youtube_automation.py
3. First, the program will ask for gmail ID input. Enter your gmail ID or "projecttest178@gmail.com" which is a test account I created for this project and click enter key.
4. Second, the program will ask for your password. Enter the corresponding account password or enter "testpassword@123" corresponding to the test account that I created and click enter key.
5. Next, the program will ask for input terms which the program will search on YouTube.
6. Next, it will print top ten results for the search, and asks to input which video should be played. Finally, it asks whether you like or disliked to video and after entering corresponding input, the programs exits, while the browser stays open.
